September 26, 1964
Saturday

I have not eaten my breakfast when I
went to school.  All of us were present du-
ring that day because we would have our
first periodical in Physics.

The test was very difficult especially
the problems.  We were not allowed to 
take our recess.  We had our lunch in
school.  I felt very hungry when the
test was over.  It was somehow two o'clock
in the afternoon.  Still, I did not went
home and played basketball instead.  As
soon as I arrived home I immediately 
attacked my lunch then took a rest.
