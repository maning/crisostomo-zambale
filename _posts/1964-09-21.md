Sept 21, 1964

Monday

We were given test in Literat-
ure.  The test was not as difficult
yet, I got low due to my lazi-
ness.  I hardly passed the median.

"I don't know what is happening
on me.  I no longer want to study
my lesson.  All my ratings in Eng-
lish, Spanish, Physics, Literature are
getting low.  Even Pilipino is dimi-
nishing."

When the period was over I went
to the office to do my typing chores
Mr. Begansok dictated to me resolu-
tions 13 and 12 and 14.  I immediate-
ly typed them.  I hurried my work
in order to help my companions
in sweeping.  The task was now 
over and Francisco and me were
taking ouw walk home.

At the the west I could see the sun in
crimsoned red while little clouds
seemed to parade the sky.  The busy
peasant was now on his way home,
the lover birds flew to their nest,
as the church bell tolled the parting 
day.

It was a beautiful night.  The sil-
very moon was on its full shape.
The phosphorent flow of mountain breeze
seemed to fill the air.  The moon 
called me to play but there was 
no time to enjoy.  I was no long-
er a child besides I must study
for the following day there would
be an examination.
