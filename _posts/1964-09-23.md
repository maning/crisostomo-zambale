Sept. 23, 1964

Wednesday

Mrs. Modelo collapsed due to
intense anger.  She was immediately
helped by the students and the fac-
ulty members to regain conscious-
ness.

Upon returning the examina-
tion notebook to the owners, one of
the students (Necito Galido) tried to
cheat her by adding points to his 
former score.  He did it by expun-
jing the summary of scores, and
by adding more check on his
notebook.  Moreover his twenty-seven
score-to-be became 37.  Fortunately,
I was the corrector of his paper.
When he returned the notebook to the
table I probed it and I caught 
his trick.  I showed the notebook
to Mrs. Modelo and from there he
insulted and scolded Necito
which resulted to her collapse.
