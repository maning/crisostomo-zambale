September 27, 1964
Sunday

I was waiting for the second mass
when I met Rodolfo Olaer near the school
stair.  We talked much of our study. He
said he was studying in Urios College
(Butuan City) and he was going straight.
I in return told him the sad ac-
count of my loss in election. Our con-
versation was very interesting that we 
felt not parting yet it ended.

When I arrived home I went to
the elementary school and typed neces-
sarry papers for the Barrio Council
for it was my obligation as secretary
of that council.
